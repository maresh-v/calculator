Calculator by Vít Mareš

An application with basic calculator functions, hardware keyboard control, input validation and the ability to switch colour themes. Themes are also selected based on the user's system preference and saved between sessions.

I created the application myself without any specific instructions with the possible exception of solving partial problems.

Assignment and design according to Frontend Mentor website: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29
